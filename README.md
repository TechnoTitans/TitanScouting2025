# 2025 Scouting App Instructions
*not formatted well yet

## Purpose:
This app was made to gather data on individual robots' play and acheivements during matches in FRC (FIRST Robotics Tournament). The data is then used to make informed decisions for our team's strategy during matches and when forming alliances with other teams.

## FRC 2025 Game (Reefscape) Rules Manual:

# Usage
## Starting Page:
To begin scouting a match, first click the start button.

## Pregame Information Page
Type in the match number, and choose the position are scouting on using the buttons. The position should be the same for every match you scout. The team number should automatically pop up, but if you are sure there is a mistake, change it.

## Autonomous Period Page
This is the place where the autonomous path is recorded. When the game starts, the robots follow a pre-programmed path, scoring coral on the reef, harvesting algae from the reef, and/or collecting additional coral to score. First, click on the starting position of the robot. 
1. On the right-hand side of this page, 3 circles represent the starting position of the robot. Select the appropriate checkbox based on which position your robot is positioned at (you will not be able to select multiple). 
  a. Source: Any place a robot starts that is towards the source, including a robot that lines up with the barge on the source side
  b. Middle: Any place a robot starts that is directly in front of the barge, whether it is lined up or not
  c. Processor: Any place a robot starts that is towards the processor, including a robot that lines up with the barge on the processor side
3. There is a checkbox labeled "LEAVE" at the top left of the page. If the robot has attained the LEAVE points, it should be checked.
4. Then, click the position the robot approaches to score, whether it scores or not. If the robot scores, click the button depicting that the shot was made. Then, click the button of the the level that the robot scored on. If the robot does not score, click the button depicting that the shot was not made. We will be measuring the accuracy of auto later, so keep that in mind as you record the auto path.
5. If you are to scouting the blue alliance, the elements listed above will be reflected horizontally. This is so the screen matches what the blue half of the field looks like.
6. The other aspects of this page involve tracking the game pieces scored/missed by the robot being scouted. For coral scored in the reef, note what level it was scored in. For algae scored in the barge or net. If you happen to make a mistake and accidentally click the plus even though nothing was scored, you can click the minus button to remove the faulty entry.
7. The autonomous page should be used only during the autonomous period (first 15 seconds of the game). 
8. After the autonomous period is over and all entries that apply have been completed, go to the Teleop page by clicking the button labeled "To Teleop" at the top right.

## Teleoperated Period Page
This page has several design elements representing each level of the reef. The turquoise plus represents points scored or missed on each corresponding level, and the minus buttons indicate any bad entry. The blue net and processor plus buttons toggle all successful attempts by the robot, and the minus buttons are for correction.

## Endgame Page
Click the buttons that match the actions the robot you are scouting made.
Ending Position: Where the robot is located on the stage at the end of the match.
Park: The robot is fully parked under the barge zone. 
Deep Cage: The robot was able to fully get off the ground and hang on the deep cage chain
Attempted Deep Cage: The robot attempted to climb onto the chain, but couldn't (either due to it falling off the chain, the robot not being able to get off the ground fully, or the robot not having enough time to climb even though they were trying)
Shallow Cage: The robot could fully get off the ground and hang on the shallow cage chain.
Attempted Shallow Cage: The robot attempted to climb onto the chain, but couldn't (either due to it falling off the chain, the robot not being able to get off the ground fully, or the robot not having enough time to climb even though they were trying)
None: If the robot does nothing or is not able to park in time.
Net: The robots can score the algae in the net. If the robot attempted to score in the net, mention it in the comments.
Shots from the Processor: The human player can now score the algae into the net. If the human player attempted to score in the net, mention it in the comments. 
Rating Guides (For Driver Quality, Defense Ability, Mechanical Reliability):
Penalties: The number of penalties the robot caused. Use the judges' calls and your knowledge of the rules to determine whether there was a penalty on the robot.
Drops Pieces: The robot often drops coral or algae, whether during pickup at the source, collisions, or any other time. If this is applicable, click the checkbox and specify in the comments page.
Comments: Type anything important the app did not let you log here (notable details about the robot/team/strategy). Try your best to keep comments very concise (there is a cap of 50 characters).

## Summary Page
This page allows you to confirm any information entered. After reviewing and correcting information, you can click, "Submit."
This brings you to the QR screen.

## Logs Page
Past match data can be viewed and accessed here. When you send your data to be scanned, click the match number of the match you scout to open a summary similar to the Summary page earlier. The most recent matches will be at the top, and the older matches will be further down the page.

Once you get to this page, click the QR button to open a QR code. 	
The box here will have the QR code of the match you just scouted. Show this to the scanner, who will scan and transfer this data to the database.
Or you can find this QR code by quitting everything and clicking on the Logs button on the homepage.
Congratulations! You just scouted a match.


## A Message to Scouters
Even though it may feel like a chore at times, scouting is important, and someone has to do it. When it's done properly, it can help win games, or even entire events.
For example: during Worlds 2025, our scouting data got messed up for a single team in a single match - 118 Robonauts in Quals 38. This single error led to our average coral made count and average cycle attempt count to be greater than 118's. In other words - in our records, we were almost just as desirable an alliance partner as them. To anyone who saw both our team's and 118's performances that season, this would be pretty ridiculous, but data is data.
Although the mistake didn't matter much in this case, it really highlights the effect of bad data. Although we end up with  hundreds of lines of data, each team only has 12 at district events, or 10 at Worlds. That means each match consistently accounts for 8-10% of the total data for a team, and therefore 8-10% of our knowledge and perception of a robot, when time comes to making match strategy or a picklist. And with how close playoff matches get (watch DCMP 2024 Playoffs Match 9), knowing exactly which team to pick can give the boost needed to win.
